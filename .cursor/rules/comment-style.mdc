# Comment Style Guidelines

- Keep comments minimal and directly relevant to the current code.
- Avoid any explanations/referencing of before/after changes or refactor history.
- Prefer brief one-line doc comments for public APIs and important logic.
- Remove superfluous comments when refactoring to maintain clarity.
